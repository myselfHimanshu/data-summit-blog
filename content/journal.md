Starting March 1st, 2021, I will spend the next year trying to master twelve expert-level skills — devoting one month to each skill and writing daily about the process. I’m calling the project **Month to Master (M2M)**.

The goal here, is to see how far I can take my skillset with only a month of rapid skill development. You can learn anything you want, while having a full-time job, social life + other life obligations.

The ability to learn is a superpower and once we cultivate this superpower, we can get whatever we want in our lives.

> It's only when we're pushed to our absoulte limits that we can truly shine.

I’ll write about my progress daily in my journal tag to force public accountability. The purpose of this post, will be to outline the skills I plan to master + rules for this challenge. Not only will this be a challenge in learning, this will be a challenge in self-discipline.
