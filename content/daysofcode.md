- Book : [Teach yourself C++ in One Hour a Day.](https://g.co/kgs/bCYnch)
- C++ 101. Anatomy of C++. Variables and declaring constants.
- Now that i have completed 3 chapters I should start with some coding practice too. Let's signup on Hackerrank and do some C++ coding challenges. Easy challenges will help in building the concepts. Signup for 30 days code challenge and practice C++ section.
- Cpp badge 3 stars achieved.

- Book : [Teach yourself C++ in One Hour a Day.](https://g.co/kgs/bCYnch)
- Hackerrank 30 days of code, challenge 3 finished.
- It's better to start with basic competitive coding in C++ and get hands on. It's okay to search google for syntax but not okay to look at answer before attempting.
