Target :

- [ ] [Teach yourself C++ in One Hour a Day. LESSON 1](https://g.co/kgs/bCYnch)

Learnings and Code Links :

- Hello World CPP program.
- Difference between interpreter and a compiler ?
  - interpreter is an intermediate byte code
  - compiler takes code as input and generates an object file.
- Job of linker
  - code has dependencies, libraries and functions in other code files. Creating links and generating an executable that integrates all these dependencies is the job of the linker.
- Steps in development cycle
  - code, compile, link, execute, debug, fix repeat
