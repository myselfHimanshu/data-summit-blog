## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Himanshu. I love programming in Python. Personally, I am passionate about programming and learning new things. My favorite way to work is late at night with headphones. ðŸ˜‰

## What I do?
Machine Learning fascinates me a lot; Self driving car, YOLO, AlphaGo, Watson and many more, these things are so cool !! Isn't it? <br />
My areas of interest include conversational as well as transactional chat bots, machine intelligence, computer vision. I am a self learner, developing my skills undertaking moocs.

## What else?
I spend my spare time watching any sci-fi or thriller TV-Series. I also love listening to music and playing cricket.<br />
I aim to use this blog to communicate technical concepts in an accessible way. Comments are welcome. At the blog, I will post some more verbose things. Will see how it will go.
