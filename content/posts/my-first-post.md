Hello everyone, this blog will be about trying things out. We will build some deep learning, computer vision, nlp, chatbots models end to end. What I mean is, we will create web applications for the models and provide access to everyone.

I will share a separate page for the resources or link the sources at the end of blog post.

I am not plagiarising the content from anyone, if I find a code that I can use directly, I will use it and add the source at the end. If you feel like there is anything that I shouldn't have done, please contact me.

This is my way to understand things and learn things.
